README for Thread::Synchronize

Adds the ": synchronize" CODE attribute so that a specific subroutine is
only run by a single thread simultaneously.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
